#initialize git in the folder
git init
#add remote repository (this did not work for me)
git remote add origin https://myusername@bitbucket.org/myusername/myrepo.git
#...so i changed it later (after some git add and commit commands)
git remote set-url origin https://myusername@bitbucket.org/myusername/myrepo.git
#now it worked:
git push -u origin master
